# Welcome to the Growth And Resilience across Development (GARD) Lab!

Welcome to the GARD Lab! Effective research is done in teams, so we are always pumped about new adding new team members! This manual outlines expectations for all lab members, a code of conduct, and general lab policies. If you are new to the GARD Lab, read through the entire lab manual. Contact Dr. Gard with any questions, concerns, or suggestions for making our lab manual more accessible (there is always room to grow!). 

## Mission Statement

The GARD Lab studies how environments shape brain and behavioral development. We strive to do good science - research that is reliable, generalizable, and innovative. We are dedicated to serving families in the DC Metro Area by advocating for environmental equity through research and championing community resilience. Our goals reflect the diversity of our experiences as students, scientists, and community members.  

## Expectations and Responsibilities

### Everyone

Science is hard. Sometimes really hard. Whether you are an undergraduate student, post-bachelors research assistant, community member research assistant, graduate student, postdoctoral scholar, or faculty member (yes, this includes Dr. Gard), science can be frustrating. There will always be bumps in the road, and this is normal. What matters is the research process and how we can leverage our collective knowledge (including our "failures") for the greater good. In the GARD Lab, we want all lab members to have a positive experience that is engaging, rewarding, and free from hostility. Here are some things we all can do to make this happen:
* Do work that you are passionate about. Life is really too short
* Do not rush your work. Plan out your tasks. Double-check and triple-check your work
* Ask for help. Never be embarassed to ask for what you need - whether this is another set of eyes on a piece of code or data, an extension on a deadline, time to think, etc.
* Do not tamper with, plagarize, make up, or omit data.
* Treat others how you want to be treated. Respect your fellow lab mates' strengths and weaknesses, respect their desire for quiet if they need it and support when they want it. Respect their culture, religion, their beliefs, their sexual orientation, and any other part of their identity. 
* If you are struggling, tell someone. Your health and happiness comes first. We can't do good and just science without taking breaks and recharging. 
* If there is any tension of hostility in the lab, address it immediately. We cannot thrive in an environment that we are not comfortable in; hostility and disrespect will not be tolerated. If you don't feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Dr. Gard. Tell Dr. Gard or a lab manager in any case.
* If you have a problem with Dr. Gard are comfortable telling her, please do. We are all learning and growing. Dr. Gard will make mistakes just like everyone else. If you don't feel comfortable, talk to a lab manager or another member of the Psychology or NACS Departments.
* Respect our participants, who are are giving up their time and energy to be involved in research. Always act professionally with participants over the phone and in person, do not leave them waiting. Keep in mind that participants may have different political and religious beliefs, sexual orientations, family compositions, and have had very different life experiences, to you and/or your friends. Please conduct yourself in a way that respects their unique situation and personhood.
* Have a life outside of the lab, take care of your mental and physical health, and never feel bad for taking time off work, and donâ€™t make others feel bad for doing that either.  

### Principle Investigator
All of the "everyone" expectations above as well as:
* I will support you in your training and career choices. Whether you aim to land a position in an academic setting, policy or government agency, private practice, nonprofit institution, etc. - your life, your choices. My job is to make sure you have the support that you need to thrive.
* I will provide feedback on trainee papers, grant proposals, or anything else within 2 weeks. 


### Graduate Students
All of the "everyone" expectations above as well as:

### Lab Staff 
All of the "everyone" expectations above as well as:

### Undergraduate Research Assistants 
All of the "everyone" expectations above as well as:
* Work in the lab for 2 semesters or more. This policy is important for ensuring that undergraduate RAs have enough time to master a skill (e.g., coding videos, running a data collection protocol, quality control of brain images) and to build effective lab relationships. It is hard to get to know someone in a 3-4 month period!
* There are no volunteer positions in the Gard Lab. We believe that all research assistants (at every level) should be compensated for their time. Compensation may be in the form of course credit through Psych 478 or hourly pay. In general, the first semester in the lab is for course credit. Pending satisfactory performance, the second semester and beyond will be hourly pay at $15/hour. If you took a course with Dr. Gard, she may be able to waive the first semester of course credit. 
* Complete a semester expectations document at the beginning of each semester. In this document, you will outline how many hours per week you intend to work and when, your training goals, your preferred gender pronouns, and any dietary restrictions (yes, events involving food will occur). 
* Complete a semester review form at the end of each semester. In this document, you will work with Dr. Gard to gauge your progress and provide feedback on lab activities and culture. 
* Answer emails within 24 hours on weekdays. 
* If you are working on a shared project in Slack, respond to Slack messages within 24 hours on weekdays.
* Log your hours each week on google drive. 
* If you have a question, ask one of your peer undergraduate RAs before asking senior staff. Use Slack to reduce email where possible!
* If you need something signed or written from Dr. Gard or another senior staff member, give at least 2 weeks lead-time. 

## Code of Conduct

### Essential University Policies

### Scientific Integrity

### Human Subjects Research

### General Lab Policies
There are a few day-to-day things to keep in mind to ensure the lab runs smoothly
* If you are sick, stay home and take care of yourself. If you are sick, reschedule your meetings as soon as you can
* You are not expected to come into the lab on weekends unless collected data with community members or participating in community events. If you do have to work on weekends, take time off during the week. 
* Show up to your meetings, show up to run participants, show up to your classes, and show up to lab meetings. Rescheduling is fine. No-showing is not. If it becomes a pattern, Dr. Gard or one of the lab managers will reach out to open a dialogue about solutions.
* Make sure the door to the lab is locked if no one is inside. Turn off the lights if you are the last one leaving for the day
* Keep the lab tidy. Eating in the lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, and spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered. Disinfect surface that you use before you leave
* Be on time. Respect everyone's (peers, participants, PI) time. 
* Come to meetings with Dr. Gard with an agenda. 
* Dress code is casual. You can dress up if you want; you can wear jeans; you can wear workout clothes. On visit with participants or when presenting your work, keep is professional, keep it classy. This doesn't mean suits and ties; this does mean wearing outfits that don't risk making someone feel uncomfortable.
