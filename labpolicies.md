# Welcome to the Growth And Resilience across Development (GARD) Lab!

Welcome to the GARD Lab! Effective research is done in teams, so we are always pumped about new adding new team members! This manual outlines expectations for all lab members, a code of conduct, and general lab policies. If you are new to the GARD Lab, read through the entire lab manual. Contact Dr. Gard with any questions, concerns, or suggestions for making our lab manual more accessible (there is always room to grow). 

## Mission Statement

The GARD Lab studies how environments shape brain and behavioral development. We strive to do good science - research that is reliable, generalizable, and innovative. We are dedicated to serving families in the DC Metro Area by advocating for environmental equity through research and championing community resilience. Our goals reflect the diversity of our experiences as students, scientists, and community members.  

## Expectations and Responsibilities

### Everyone

Science is hard. Sometimes really hard. Whether you are an undergraduate student, post-bachelors research assistant, community member research assistant, graduate student, postdoctoral scholar, or faculty member (yes, this includes Dr. Gard), science can be frustrating. There will always be bumps in the road, and this is normal. What matters is the research process and how we can leverage our collective knowledge (including our "failures") for the greater good. In the GARD Lab, we want all lab members to have a positive experience that is engaging, rewarding, and free from hostility. Here are some things we all can do to make this happen:
* Do work that you are passionate about. Life is really too short
* Do not rush your work. Plan out your tasks. Double-check and triple-check your work
* Ask for help. Never be embarassed to ask for what you need - whether this is another set of eyes on a piece of code or data, an extension on a deadline, time to think, etc.
* Do not tamper with, plagarize, make up, or omit data.
