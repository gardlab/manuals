# Welcome to the Growth And Resilience across Development (GARD) Lab!

Welcome to the GARD Lab! Effective research is done in teams, so we are always pumped about new adding new team members! This manual outlines expectations for all lab members, a code of conduct, and general lab policies. If you are new to the GARD Lab, read through the entire lab manual. Contact Dr. Gard with any questions, concerns, or suggestions for making our lab manual more accessible (there is always room to grow!). 

## Mission Statement

The GARD Lab studies how environments shape brain and behavioral development. We strive to do good science - research that is reliable, generalizable, and innovative. We are dedicated to serving families in the DC Metro Area by advocating for environmental equity through research and championing community resilience. Our goals reflect the diversity of our experiences as students, scientists, and community members.  

## Expectations and Responsibilities

### Everyone

Science is hard. Sometimes really hard. Whether you are an undergraduate student, post-bachelors research assistant, community member research assistant, graduate student, postdoctoral scholar, or faculty member (yes, this includes Dr. Gard), science can be frustrating. There will always be bumps in the road, and this is normal. What matters is the research process and how we can leverage our collective knowledge (including our "failures") for the greater good. In the GARD Lab, we want all lab members to have a positive experience that is engaging, rewarding, and free from hostility. Here are some things we all can do to make this happen:
* Do work that you are passionate about. Life is really too short
* Do not rush your work. Plan out your tasks. Double-check and triple-check your work
* Ask for help. Never be embarassed to ask for what you need - whether this is another set of eyes on a piece of code or data, an extension on a deadline, time to think, etc.
* Do not tamper with, plagarize, make up, or omit data.
* Treat others how you want to be treated. Respect your fellow lab mates' strengths and weaknesses, respect their desire for quiet if they need it and support when they want it. Respect their culture, religion, their beliefs, their sexual orientation, and any other part of their identity. 
* If you are struggling, tell someone. Your health and happiness comes first. We can't do good and just science without taking breaks and recharging. 
* If there is any tension of hostility in the lab, address it immediately. We cannot thrive in an environment that we are not comfortable in; hostility and disrespect will not be tolerated. If you don't feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Dr. Gard. Tell Dr. Gard or a lab manager in any case.
* If you have a problem with Dr. Gard are comfortable telling her, please do. We are all learning and growing. Dr. Gard will make mistakes just like everyone else. If you don't feel comfortable, talk to a lab manager or another member of the Psychology or NACS Departments.
* Respect our participants, who are are giving up their time and energy to be involved in research. Always act professionally with participants over the phone and in person, do not leave them waiting. Keep in mind that participants may have different political and religious beliefs, sexual orientations, family compositions, and have had very different life experiences, to you and/or your friends. Please conduct yourself in a way that respects their unique situation and personhood.
* Have a life outside of the lab, take care of your mental and physical health, and never feel bad for taking time off work, and donâ€™t make others feel bad for doing that either.

### General Lab Policies
There are a few day-to-day things to keep in mind to ensure the lab runs smoothly
* If you are sick, stay home and take care of yourself. If you are sick, reschedule your meetings as soon as you can
* You are not expected to come into the lab on weekends unless collected data with community members or participating in community events. If you do have to work on weekends, take time off during the week. 
* Show up to your meetings, show up to run participants, show up to your classes, and show up to lab meetings. Rescheduling is fine. No-showing is not. If it becomes a pattern, Dr. Gard or one of the lab managers will reach out to open a dialogue about solutions.
* Make sure the door to the lab is locked if no one is inside. Turn off the lights if you are the last one leaving for the day
* Keep the lab tidy. Eating in the lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, and spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered. Disinfect surface that you use before you leave
* Be on time. Respect everyone's (peers, participants, PI) time. 
* Come to meetings with Dr. Gard with an agenda. 
* Dress code is casual. You can dress up if you want; you can wear jeans; you can wear workout clothes. On visit with participants or when presenting your work, dress more professionally. That means no pajamas or crop tops or short-shorts. This doesn't mean suits and ties; this does mean wearing outfits that don't risk making someone feel uncomfortable.
