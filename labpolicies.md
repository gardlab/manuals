# Welcome to the Growth And Resilience across Development (GARD) Lab!

Welcome to the GARD Lab! Effective research is done in teams, so we are always pumped about new adding new team members! This manual outlines expectations for all lab members, a code of conduct, and general lab policies. If you are new to the GARD Lab, read through the entire lab manual. Contact me (Dr. Gard) with any questions, concerns, or suggestions for making our lab manual more accessible (there is always room to grow!). 

## Mission Statement

Our lab studies how environments shape brain and behavioral development. We strive to do good science - research that is reliable, generalizable, and innovative. We are dedicated to serving families in the DC Metro Area by advocating for environmental equity through research and championing community resilience. Our goals reflect the diversity of our experiences as students, scientists, and community members.  

## Expectations and Responsibilities

### Everyone

Science is hard. Sometimes really hard. Whether you are an undergraduate student, post-bachelors research assistant, community member research assistant, graduate student, postdoctoral scholar, or faculty member, science can be frustrating. There will always be bumps in the road, and this is normal. What matters is the research process and how we can leverage our collective knowledge (including our "failures") for the greater good. In our lab, we want all lab members to have a positive experience that is engaging, rewarding, and free from hostility. Here are some things we all can do to make this happen:
* Do work that you are passionate about. Life is really too short
* Do not rush your work. Plan out your tasks. Double-check and triple-check your work
* Ask for help. Never be embarassed to ask for what you need - whether this is another set of eyes on a piece of code or data, an extension on a deadline, time to think, etc.
* Do not tamper with, plagarize, make up, or omit data.
* Treat others how you want to be treated. Respect your fellow lab mates' strengths and weaknesses, respect their desire for quiet if they need it and support when they want it. Respect their culture, religion, their beliefs, their sexual orientation, and any other part of their identity. 
* If you are struggling, tell someone. Your health and happiness comes first. We can't do good and just science without taking breaks and recharging. 
* If there is any tension of hostility in the lab, address it immediately. We cannot thrive in an environment that we are not comfortable in; hostility and disrespect will not be tolerated. If you don't feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell me or a lab manager
* We are all learning and growing. I will make mistakes, just like everyone else. If you feel comfortable, please come talk to me. Or you can talk to a lab manager or another member of the Psychology or NACS Departments.
* Respect our participants, who are are giving up their time and energy to be involved in research. Always act professionally with participants over the phone and in person, do not leave them waiting. Keep in mind that participants may have different political and religious beliefs, sexual orientations, family compositions, and/or different life experiences than you. Please conduct yourself in a way that respects the diversity of our identities and experiences.
* Have a life outside of the lab, take care of your mental and physical health, and never feel bad for taking time off work, and don’t make others feel bad for doing that either.  

### Principal Investigator
All of the "everyone" expectations above as well as:
* Guide the research program in the lab. 
* Support you in your training and career choices (e.g., by introducing you to other researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, writing recommendation letters for you, and supporting your attendence conferences). Whether you aim to land a position in an academic setting, policy or government agency, private practice, nonprofit institution, etc. - your life, your choices. Dr. Gard's job is to make sure you have the support that you need to thrive.
* Provide feedback on trainee papers, grant proposals, or anything else you need within 2 weeks. 
* Be available in person and/or on slack during weekday business hours, and be available for regular trainee-mentee meetings
* Write grants to support research and trainees.
* Prepare agenda items for lab meetings and organize lab trainings when needed (e.g., factor analysis; fMRI image processing) 

### Graduate Students
All of the "everyone" expectations above as well as:
* Think critically about what you want for your career (academia – research or teaching, industry, policy, clinical practice or hospital-based work). It is never too early to start discussing this with Dr. Gard so that we can make sure you are getting the types of training you need.  
* Become an expert in a well-defined research area. I will work with you to identify 2-3 research areas of interest. Based on the lab's foci, one of these research areas will likely be a bio modality (e.g., epigenetic methylation, functional MRI, stress physiology). By the time you leave UMD, you will know more about these topics than me (this is how it should be!). This requires you to take ownership of your expertise - strategize with me, other mentors, and your lab-mates about how to build this knowledge. 
* Use existing secondary data for some of your projects. Why do we use secondary data? Brilliant researchers before us have spent years collecting large, statistically well-powered datasets; individuals and families have donated their time to make this research possible; funding organizations have supported this research financially. By utilizing secondary datasets, we are acknowledging these enormous efforts. The GARD Lab engages in a mix of primary data collection and secondary data analysis; your research activities should reflect this.      
* Document your work. Every time you write or modify a script, develop a protocol, or identify a resource, document it! This type of information can be thought of as "lab knowledge"; documentation ensures that we don't repeat ourselves. 
* Follow the scientist-mentor model. As you know from the application process, prospective students are accepted into the program to work with one primary faculty mentor. Your mentor is intended to guide you through the program and is required to "sign-off" on most department-related decisions. Thus, consult with me often about anything from course selection, research activities, desired training, etc. 
* Related to the scientist-mentor model, the topic and scope of your first 1-2 manuscripts in the lab will be guided by me. This will be informed by your topical interests. As you develop as a scholar (both in terms of your interests and expertise), you will begin to develop your own paper ideas independently. 
* Contribute to ongoing projects in the lab. This may mean collecting and/or analyzing data. Every effort will be made to have these activities overlap with the your individual projects. Outside of your GA- or TA-ship, you are expected to work in the lab 20 hours per week (on average). 
* Take an active role in protocol and research project development. If you see a more efficient way to accomplish a task, bring your ideas "to the table". 
* Make sure you meet all departmental and external lab deadlines (e.g., exams, thesis, grant applications) – and make sure I am aware of them!
* Mentor undergraduate students in the lab. Undergraduate students may be paired with a trainee if interests align (max 1 per semester). Oftentimes, an undegraduate student will be helping your with your project. When you are the day-to-day mentor, you are responsible for communicating your expectations, project goals, etc. You can expect to meet with them one-on-one every other week or so.  
* Be available 1 weekend per month for project data collection and/or lab outreach. 
* Update your weekend avilability at the beginning of the semester and anytime scheduling conflicts arise.

### Lab Staff (Project Coordinator, Lab Manager)
All of the "everyone" expectations above as well as:
* Document your work. Every time you write or modify a script, develop a protocol, or identify a resource, document it! This type of information can be thought of as "lab knowledge"; documentation ensures that we don't repeat ourselves.
* Take meeting notes and generate to-do lists. Consult with me and senior staff members to generate appropriate deadlines. 
* Collect data for ongoing projects in the lab.
* Take an active role in protocol and research project development. If you see a more efficient way to accomplish a task, bring your ideas to the "table".
* Help mentor undergraduate students in the lab. Oftentimes, an undegraduate student will be helping you with your job responsibilites. When you are the day-to-day mentor, you are responsible for communicating your expectations, project goals, etc.
* Develop your own research project using an existing dataset. In general, full-time staff are protected ~1 day/week to work on their own project. This is unlikely to be "enough" time to see a paper through to completion. Thus, depending on your own goals, you will have to work on your paper on your own time in addition to during protected lab time.
* Flexibly adapt to weekly needs. Although your tasks will be predictable most of the time, things may come up that need attention immediately. Adjust your expectations accordingly. If someone in the lab or an external collaborator is expecting something of you, communicate an updated due date.
* Log your hours each week by task and/or project. This will guide our expectations for how much time things take to complete.
* Be available on the weekends for project data collection and/or outreach. These hours will be deducted from your M-F schedule (e.g., work on Saturday, Monday off). 
* Update your weekend avilability at the beginning of the semester and anytime scheduling conflicts arise.

### Undergraduate Research Assistants 
All of the above, as well as:
* Work in the lab for 2 semesters or more. This policy is important for ensuring that undergraduate RAs have enough time to master a skill (e.g., coding videos, running a data collection protocol, quality control of brain images) and to build effective lab relationships. It is hard to get to know someone in a 3-4 month period!
* There are no volunteer positions in the Gard Lab. We believe that all research assistants (at every level) should be compensated for their time. Compensation may be in the form of course credit through Psych 479 or hourly pay. In general, your first semester in the lab will be for course credit. Pending satisfactory performance, your second semester and beyond will be for hourly pay at $15/hour. If you took a course with me, I may be able to waive the first semester of course credit. 
* Update the avilability calendar at the beginning of the semester and anytime scheduling conflicts arise. Log your hours each week. 
* Document your time and activities in the lab *weekly by Friday* using the following google sheets link. Please make sure to click 'Add Sheet' on the bottom left corner, rename it using your name, and use the formatting as indicated on the first page. This file is located in the Gard Lab All Box in the RA -> Timesheets folder. 
* If you have a question, ask one of your peer undergraduate RAs before asking senior staff. 
* If you need something signed or written from me or another senior staff member, give at least 2 weeks lead-time. 

## Code of Conduct
The University of Maryland maintains a Code of Conduct for students (https://studentconduct.umd.edu/home/current-students) and staff/faculty (https://studentconduct.umd.edu/home/faculty-staff). This code of conduct pertains to both academic and non-academic misconduct. In addition, the University and the GARD Lab are committed to maintaining a working and learning environment free from sexual misconduct and discrimination; policies and procedures have been developed by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (https://ocrsm.umd.edu/). At the broadest level, the following classes of behaviors are prohibited:

>**Discrimination** is unequal treatment based on a legally protected status that is serious enough to unreasonably interfere with or limit an individual’s ability to participate in or benefit from a University program or activity, or that otherwise negatively affects a term or condition of the individual’s employment or education.

>**Harassment** is discrimination in the form of unwelcome conduct based on a person’s protected status that negatively affects the particular individual and also would negatively affect a reasonable person under the same circumstances. Harassment can be verbal, physical, written, graphic, electronic or otherwise displayed or communicated.

>**Retaliation** is action(s) taken against an individual because they reported discrimination, filed a complaint of discrimination, or participated in an investigation or proceeding concerning a discrimination complaint.

>**Sexual Harassment, Other Sexual Misconduct, and Retaliation** may occur between strangers or acquaintances, including people involved in an intimate or sexual relationship. Prohibited Conduct can be committed by any person, regardless of gender identity, and can occur between people of the same or different sex, sexual orientation, or gender expression. 

### Scientific Integrity
#### Open Science
We are committed to producing high-quality reproducible research. We should be able to give our data and code to another researcher to replicate our results. This practice is NOT intended to "catch" bad actors, but to make sure our research findings are reliable. "Open Science" practices are essential to reproducability.

One component is documenting everything. Every paper you work on should be accompanied by an activity log, which includes things like analytic decisions, filenames and paths, and meeting notes. Analytic code should also be commented clearly. We all know what it’s like to sit down, quickly write a bunch of code to run an analysis without taking time to comment it, and then having no idea what we did a few months down the road. Comment your code so that every step is understandable by an outsider. Use some form of version control (e.g., Git in combination with GitHub) to keep track of what code changes you made and when you made them, as well as sharing code with others.

Another component is constructing "replication packages". For any publically-availble datasets or data that we can release to the world, your paper needs to be accompanied by a replication package. The lab uses R, so your replication package will be in the form of a script or set of scripts. Your code should include any pacakges that are needed to process and analyze the data, and guided comments (as noted above). The GARD Lab data manager or another graduate student working with the same dataset will test your replication pacakge. At the time of paper submission, you will post your replication pacakge to your OSF site (and tag Dr. Gard and other collaborators). 

#### Authorship
Authorship is an important part of research and should be determined at the beginning of a project. Like other labs, we follow authorship guidelines as noted by the APA:
>“Authorship credit should reflect the individual’s contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or   contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published.”

At the start of a new project, the trainee who is driving the paper can expect to be the first author. Dr. Gard will be the senior (i.e., last) author. Students and post-docs who help over the course of the project may also be "middle authors" depending on their contributions; the positioning (i.e., where in the author list, not existence in the author list, which should be decided at the beginning of the project) of non-primary and non-senior authors will be decided when the paper is in the write-up phase. If a trainee takes on a project but subsequently hands it off to someone else, they will most likely be handing over first-authorship too (they may also be co-first author, if that is appropriate). All of these issues are open to discussion. However, if at any time trainees are unsure of "where they stand", raise these issues immediately to Dr. Gard. We do not want to foster resentment or uncertainty over authorship. Instead, we want to focus our effort on the work!

See the "Authorship Guidelines" document in the manuals folder of Github for more information. 

### Human Subjects Research
Adherence to approved IRB protocols is essential, and non-adherence can lead to severe consequences for the entire lab (i.e., we may lose permission to run any research on human participants). Part of respecting our participants means that we must strictly adhere to the IRB protocol for each project. All lab members must read the IRB protocol and consent forms for any project that they are working on. This is also a great way to familiarize yourself with project, and you are also welcome to read the IRB protocols of other projects in the lab that you are not working on to learn more about them. If you are not on the IRB, you cannot run participants, look at the data, analyze the data, or be in any way involved with the project.

Lab members must complete the appropriate training in Human Research that is specified by the specific IRB protocols they are listed in. Speak to one of the lab staff about the specifics of the IRB protocols you will be listed on and the training you have to do for them, as well as how to access and document the training.

If you are starting your own project, you will be expected to write your own IRB protocol (see Dr. Gard and your lab manager for help). If you are starting a study that sits within an existing project, you will be expected to write an amendment to that project’s IRB protocol. If you are working on an existing project, you will need to have your name added to that project’s IRB protocol. You must ensure that you have IRB approval before collecting, looking at, or manipulating data from human subjects.

Part of the training in Human Subjects research will involve reporting of incidental or unexpected events. If a participant falls ill, becomes very upset, has an accident with the lab equipment, is injured, or otherwise adversely affected by participating in the study, tell Dr. Gard so that we can report this information to the IRB and/or specific funding agencies.

### General Lab Policies
There are a few day-to-day things to keep in mind to ensure the lab runs smoothly
* If you are sick, stay home and take care of yourself. If you are sick, reschedule your meetings as soon as you can
* You are not expected to come into the lab on weekends unless collected data with community members or participating in community events. If you do have to work on weekends, take time off during the week. 
* Show up to your meetings, show up to run participants, show up to your classes, and show up to lab meetings. Rescheduling is fine. No-showing is not. If it becomes a pattern, I or one of the lab managers will reach out to open a dialogue about solutions.
* Make sure the door to the lab is locked if no one is inside. Turn off the lights if you are the last one leaving for the day
* Keep the lab tidy. Eating in the lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, and spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered. Disinfect surface that you use before you leave
* Be on time. Respect everyone's (peers, participants, PI) time. 
* Come to individual meetings with me with an agenda, which you should send ahead of time when possible.
* Dress code is casual. You can dress up if you want; you can wear jeans; you can wear workout clothes. On visit with participants or when presenting your work, keep it professional, keep it classy (this doesn't mean suits and ties!). 
* Give me, collaborators, and lab-mates 2-3 weeks lead-time on most deadlines (e.g., conference abstracts, revise & resubmit paper revisions, thesis/dissertation drafts, rec letters). For quick forms that I need to fill out, 1 week is fine.
* Any correspondence with community partners and external agencies must be explicitly approved by me. You should send your draft text to me in an email, and I will edit and respond with my approval. The same goes for bulk-email correspondence to participants and community members. 

#### Hours and Working in the Lab
Being physically present in the lab is important. In lab you can learn from others, help others, have fast and easy access to resources (and people), and build networks with your peers and senior colleagues. Although hours in academia are generally more flexible than other jobs, you should still treat it like a job. That means working 40 hours a week if you are a full-time staff member (plus any additional time needed to work on indepedent projects outside of your role responsibilities). Graduate students can expect to work 40-60 hours/week inclusive of all activities (i.e., GA/TA-ship, lab responsibilities, individual research and expertise building, classes). 

You can work from home, but not all the time, and you need to show up for all your meetings. To encourage lab interaction, you must in the lab at least 2 days per week during ‘peak’ hours (assuming no other obligations like classes). 

The only exceptions to these flexible work hours are research staff, who must keep regular hours and be in lab 5 days a week. I expect staff to be in about 8 hours a day, starting around 9am or 10am and ending around 5pm or 6pm. When you are working in your own project during protected research time, you can work remotely. However, you still must be available via email/slack. As discussed above, if you are running research participants on the weekends or after hours, you should come/leave earlier on other days of the week to compensate (another reason to document how you spend your time). 

Each of us has different working hours. Sometimes I work late at night or early in the morning. So, you may get emails or slack messages at weird hours (and vice versa). Please respect yourself and other people’s quirks – if you are not working, don’t check email or slack, and don’t feel pressured to respond outside of your working hours.

#### Communication
* Answer emails and Slack messages within 24-48 hours on weekdays. 
* Whether you are or are not physically in the lab space, you are expected to be present on Slack during your "research hours" on weekdays.
* Use meetings and electronic communication efficiently. If you have a question that could wait for a project meeting or your individual meeting, save it. If you need advice or help immediately, send an email or Slack message. 

### Outreach and Service
In addition to producing high-quality research that advocates for environmental equity and healthy child development, our lab is committed to these goals through service and outreach in our local community. Research Staff in the lab are responsible for organizing events in Prince George's County and DC, but all lab members are expected to participate in outreach events 1-2 times per semester. Appropriate dress code and behavior is expected at outreach events as during data collection. Lastly, some undergraduate RAs will be work on public science blogs on topics of their choosing (check out our first series on environmental toxins and child development: http://gardlab.umd.edu/blog/).
