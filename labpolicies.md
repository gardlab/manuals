# Welcome to the Growth And Resilience across Development (GARD) Lab!

Welcome to the GARD Lab! Effective research is done in teams, so we are always pumped about new adding new team members! This manual outlines expectations for all lab members, a code of conduct, and general lab policies. If you are new to the GARD Lab, read through the entire lab manual. Contact Dr. Gard with any questions, concerns, or suggestions for making our lab manual more accessible (there is always room to grow!). 

## Mission Statement

The GARD Lab studies how environments shape brain and behavioral development. We strive to do good science - research that is reliable, generalizable, and innovative. We are dedicated to serving families in the DC Metro Area by advocating for environmental equity through research and championing community resilience. Our goals reflect the diversity of our experiences as students, scientists, and community members.  

## Expectations and Responsibilities

### Everyone

Science is hard. Sometimes really hard. Whether you are an undergraduate student, post-bachelors research assistant, community member research assistant, graduate student, postdoctoral scholar, or faculty member (yes, this includes Dr. Gard), science can be frustrating. There will always be bumps in the road, and this is normal. What matters is the research process and how we can leverage our collective knowledge (including our "failures") for the greater good. In the GARD Lab, we want all lab members to have a positive experience that is engaging, rewarding, and free from hostility. Here are some things we all can do to make this happen:
* Do work that you are passionate about. Life is really too short
* Do not rush your work. Plan out your tasks. Double-check and triple-check your work
* Ask for help. Never be embarassed to ask for what you need - whether this is another set of eyes on a piece of code or data, an extension on a deadline, time to think, etc.
* Do not tamper with, plagarize, make up, or omit data.
* Come to individual and project-specific meetings with an agenda
* Treat others how you want to be treated. Respect your fellow lab mates' strengths and weaknesses, respect their desire for quiet if they need it and support when they want it. Respect their culture, religion, their beliefs, their sexual orientation, and any other part of their identity. 
* If you are struggling, tell someone. Your health and happiness comes first. We can't do good and just science without taking breaks and recharging. 
* If there is any tension of hostility in the lab, address it immediately. We cannot thrive in an environment that we are not comfortable in; hostility and disrespect will not be tolerated. If you don't feel comfortable confronting the person in question, tell Dr. Gard. Tell Dr. Gard or a lab manager in any case.
* If you have a problem with Dr. Gard and are comfortable telling her, please do. We are all learning and growing. Dr. Gard will make mistakes just like everyone else. If you don't feel comfortable, talk to a lab manager or another member of the Psychology or NACS Departments.
* Respect our participants, who are are giving up their time and energy to be involved in research. Always act professionally with participants over the phone and in person, do not leave them waiting. Keep in mind that participants may have different political and religious beliefs, sexual orientations, family compositions, and have had very different life experiences, to you and/or your friends. Please conduct yourself in a way that respects their unique situation and personhood.
* Have a life outside of the lab, take care of your mental and physical health, and never feel bad for taking time off work, and don’t make others feel bad for doing that either.  

### Principle Investigator
All of the "everyone" expectations above as well as:
* Support you in your training and career choices (e.g., by introducing you to other researchers in the field, promoting your work at talks, writing recommendation letters for you, and supporting your attendence conferences). Whether you aim to land a position in an academic setting, policy or government agency, private practice, nonprofit institution, etc. - your life, your choices. Dr. Gard's job is to make sure you have the support that you need to thrive.
* Provide feedback on trainee papers, grant proposals, or anything else you need within 2 weeks. 
* Be available in person and/or on slack during weekday business hours, and be available for regular trainee-mentee meetings
* Guide the research program in the lab. Adapt lab priorities to reflect trainee interests. 
* Write grants to support research and trainees. 

### Graduate Students
All of the "everyone" expectations above as well as:
* Think critically about what you want for your career (academia – research or teaching, industry, policy, clinical practice or hospital-based work). It is never too early to start discussing this with Dr. Gard so that we can make sure you are getting the types of training you need.  
* Become an expert in a well-defined research area. Dr. Gard will work with you to identify 2-3 research areas of interest. Based on the lab's foci, one of these research areas will likely be a bio modality (e.g., epigenetic methylation, functional MRI, stress physiology). By the time you leave UMD, you will know more about these topics than Dr. Gard (this is how it should be!). This requires you to take ownership of your expertise - strategize with Dr. Gard, other mentors, and your lab-mates about how to build this knowledge. 
* Use existing secondary data for some of your projects. Why do we use secondary data? Brilliant researchers before us have spent years collecting large, statistically well-powered datasets; individuals and families have donated their time to make this research possible; funding organizations have supported this research financially. By utilizing secondary datasets, we are acknowledging these enormous efforts. The GARD Lab engages in a mix of primary data collection and secondary data analysis; your research activities should reflect this.      
* Document your work. Every time you write or modify a script, develop a protocol, or identify a resource, document it! This type of information can be thought of as "lab knowledge"; documentation ensures that we don't repeat ourselves. 
* Follow the scientist-mentor model. As you know from the application process, prospective students are accepted into the program to work with one primary faculty mentor. Your mentor is intended to guide you through the program and is required to "sign-off" on most department-related decisions. Thus, consult with Dr. Gard often about anything from course selection, research activities, desired training, etc. 
* Collect data for the ongoing projects in the lab, which includes any major group projects.
* Take an active role in protocol and research project development. If you see a more efficient way to accomplish a task, bring your ideas "to the table". 
* Make sure you meet all departmental and external lab deadlines (e.g., exams, thesis, grant applications) – and make sure Dr. Gard is aware of them!
* Help mentor undergraduate students in the lab. Undergraduate students may be paired with a trainee if interests align. Oftentimes, an undegraduate student will be helping your with your project. When you are the day-to-day mentor, you are responsible for communicating your expectations, project goals, etc. 
* Be available 1 weekend per month for project data collection and/or lab outreach. 
* Update your weekend avilability at the beginning of the semester and anytime scheduling conflicts arise.

### Lab Staff 
All of the "everyone" expectations above as well as:
* Document your work. Every time you write or modify a script, develop a protocol, or identify a resource, document it! This type of information can be thought of as "lab knowledge"; documentation ensures that we don't repeat ourselves.
* Take notes in meetings and generate to-do lists. Consult with Dr. Gard and senior staff members to generate appropriate deadlines. 
* Collect data for ongoing projects in the lab.
* Take an active role in protocol and research project development. If you see a more efficient way to accomplish a task, bring your ideas to the "table".
* Help mentor undergraduate students in the lab. Oftentimes, an undegraduate student will be helping you with your job responsibilites. When you are the day-to-day mentor, you are responsible for communicating your expectations, project goals, etc.
* Develop your own research project using an existing dataset. In general, staff are protected ~1 day/week to work on their own project. This is unlikely to be "enough" time to see a paper through to completion. Thus, depending on your own goals, you will have to work on your paper on your own time in addition to during protected lab time.
* Flexibly adapt to weekly needs. Although your tasks will be predictable most of the time, things may come up that need attention immediately. Adjust your expectations accordingly. If someone in the lab or an external collaborator is expecting something of you, communicate an updated due date.
* Log your hours each week by task and/or project. This will guide our expectations for how much time things take to complete.
* Be available on the weekends for project data collection and/or outreach. These hours will be deducted from your M-F schedule (e.g., work on Saturday, Monday off). 
* Update your weekend avilability at the beginning of the semester and anytime scheduling conflicts arise.

### Undergraduate Research Assistants 
All of the above, as well as:
* Work in the lab for 2 semesters or more. This policy is important for ensuring that undergraduate RAs have enough time to master a skill (e.g., coding videos, running a data collection protocol, quality control of brain images) and to build effective lab relationships. It is hard to get to know someone in a 3-4 month period!
* There are no volunteer positions in the Gard Lab. We believe that all research assistants (at every level) should be compensated for their time. Compensation may be in the form of course credit through Psych 478 or hourly pay. In general, your first semester in the lab will be for course credit. Pending satisfactory performance, your second semester and beyond will be for hourly pay at $15/hour. If you took a course with Dr. Gard, she may be able to waive the first semester of course credit. 
* Update the avilability calendar at the beginning of the semester and anytime scheduling conflicts arise. Log your hours each week. 
* Attend lab meetings and project-specific undergraduate meetings (when scheduled). Be on time and come prepared!
* If you have a question, ask one of your peer undergraduate RAs before asking senior staff. 
* If you need something signed or written from Dr. Gard or another senior staff member, give at least 2 weeks lead-time. 

## Code of Conduct
The University of Maryland maintains a Code of Conduct for students (https://studentconduct.umd.edu/home/current-students) and staff/faculty (https://studentconduct.umd.edu/home/faculty-staff). This code of conduct pertains to both academic and non-academic misconduct. In addition, the University and the GARD Lab are committed to maintaining a working and learning environment free from sexual misconduct and discrimination; policies and procedures have been developed by the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (https://ocrsm.umd.edu/). At the broadest level, the following classes of behaviors are prohibited:

**Discrimination** is unequal treatment based on a legally protected status that is serious enough to unreasonably interfere with or limit an individual’s ability to participate in or benefit from a University program or activity, or that otherwise negatively affects a term or condition of the individual’s employment or education.

**Harassment** is discrimination in the form of unwelcome conduct based on a person’s protected status that negatively affects the particular individual and also would negatively affect a reasonable person under the same circumstances. Harassment can be verbal, physical, written, graphic, electronic or otherwise displayed or communicated.

**Retaliation** is action(s) taken against an individual because they reported discrimination, filed a complaint of discrimination, or participated in an investigation or proceeding concerning a discrimination complaint.

**Sexual Harassment, Other Sexual Misconduct, and Retaliation** may occur between strangers or acquaintances, including people involved in an intimate or sexual relationship. Prohibited Conduct can be committed by any person, regardless of gender identity, and can occur between people of the same or different sex, sexual orientation, or gender expression. 

### Scientific Integrity
#### Open Science
The GARD Lab at UMD is committed to producing high-quality reproducible research. We should be able to give our data and code to another researcher to replicate our results. This practice is NOT intended to "catch" bad actors, but to make sure our research findings are reliable. "Open Science" practices are essential to reproducability.

One component is documenting everything. Every paper you work on should be accompanied by an activity log, which includes things like analytic decisions, filenames and paths, and meeting notes. Analytic code should also be commented clearly. We all know what it’s like to sit down, quickly write a bunch of code to run an analysis without taking time to comment it, and then having no idea what we did a few months down the road. Comment your code so that every step is understandable by an outsider. Use some form of version control (e.g., Git in combination with GitHub) to keep track of what code changes you made and when you made them, as well as sharing code with others.

Another component is constructing "replication packages". For any publically-availble datasets or data that we can release to the world, your paper needs to be accompanied by a replication package. The lab uses R, so your replication package will be in the form of a script or set of scripts. Your code should include any pacakges that are needed to process and analyze the data, and guided comments (as noted above). The GARD Lab data manager or another graduate student working with the same dataset will test your replication pacakge. At the time of paper submission, you will post your replication pacakge to your OSF site (and tag Dr. Gard and other collaborators). 

#### Authorship
Authorship is an important part of research and should be determined at the beginning of a project. Like other labs, we follow authorship guidelines as noted by the APA:
>“Authorship credit should reflect the individual’s contribution to the study. An author is considered anyone involved with initial research design, data collection and analysis, manuscript drafting, and final approval. However, the following do not necessarily qualify for authorship: providing funding or resources, mentorship, or   contributing research but not helping with the publication itself. The primary author assumes responsibility for the publication, making sure that the data are accurate, that all deserving authors have been credited, that all authors have given their approval to the final draft; and handles responses to inquiries after the manuscript is published.”

### General Lab Policies
There are a few day-to-day things to keep in mind to ensure the lab runs smoothly
* If you are sick, stay home and take care of yourself. If you are sick, reschedule your meetings as soon as you can
* You are not expected to come into the lab on weekends unless collected data with community members or participating in community events. If you do have to work on weekends, take time off during the week. 
* Show up to your meetings, show up to run participants, show up to your classes, and show up to lab meetings. Rescheduling is fine. No-showing is not. If it becomes a pattern, Dr. Gard or one of the lab managers will reach out to open a dialogue about solutions.
* Make sure the door to the lab is locked if no one is inside. Turn off the lights if you are the last one leaving for the day
* Keep the lab tidy. Eating in the lab is fine, but clean up food waste, crumbs, and spills. Put lab equipment back where you found it. Keep common areas uncluttered. Disinfect surface that you use before you leave
* Be on time. Respect everyone's (peers, participants, PI) time. 
* Come to meetings with Dr. Gard with an agenda. 
* Dress code is casual. You can dress up if you want; you can wear jeans; you can wear workout clothes. On visit with participants or when presenting your work, keep it professional, keep it classy. This doesn't mean suits and ties; this does mean wearing outfits that don't risk making someone feel uncomfortable. 

#### Hours and Working in the Lab

#### Communication

* Answer emails within 24 hours on weekdays. 
* If you are working on a shared project in Slack, respond to Slack messages within 24 hours on weekdays.

#### Outreach and Service





* Complete a semester expectations document at the beginning of each semester. In this document, you will outline how many hours per week you intend to work and when, your training goals, your preferred gender pronouns, and any dietary restrictions (yes, events involving food will occur). 
* Complete a semester review form at the end of each semester. In this document, you will work with Dr. Gard to gauge your progress and provide feedback on lab activities and culture.
