# You've joined the GARD Lab! What's next?

Starting a new position can be overwhelming. Adapting to new systems, adhereing to protocols, adjusting to the lab culture - all challenging tasks (both hopefully exciting)! This onboarding manual in intended to give you a jump start. It will walk you through the tools that the lab uses, identify mandatory trainings that you will need to take, and guide you through the onboarding process. 

## Tools
The following are tools that the lab uses to run smoothly. All lab members are expected to engage with these tools to various degrees; those guidelines will be spelled out

* Github (https://github.com/gardlab/). The lab has its own github account. This account should be used to store manuals and protocols, data analysis scripts, and open-source data and stimuli. The data manager is in charge of managing the account. 
    * Since we are a new lab, we don't yet have a file organization system for our github account. One way to organize files is through data modality (e.g., all scripts related to processing fMRI data; all scripts related to processing genetic data). There may be other systems. We will develop a protocol together. 
    * Know that anything uploaded to the lab github account must be paired with a readme file
    * When you post code, make sure it is flawless because we don't want to distribute buggy code to the world. Have the data manager check it and get approval before posting. 
* Slack (https://slack.com/). Slack is a great tool to faciliate communication among lab members. Sometimes emails get lost and we all get too many emails anyways. Slack each other for quick questions. Use emails for more formal communication (e.g., to send Dr. Gard a proposal draft)
    * Install slack on your computer(s). The lab manager or Dr. Gard will add you to the gardlab slack account (gardlab.slack.com) - remind them if they don't! All senior staff (grad students, staff, postdocs) should be given administrator privledges
    * Create channels for different projects. Use the #random channel for non-work-related chats or make a private chat with another lab mate. 
    * Turn on your notifications during work hours or check Slack 1x/day on work days. 
    * Do not worry if someone slacks you after hours - you are not expected to respond, but some of us may work at odd times. 
    * Keep if professional. Add memes, make jokes, have fun - but keep the banter respectful
    * Try to keep each channel on topic, so that people can suscribe only to the channels that concern them. For messages to one person or a small group, use direct messages.
* Email. We have several lab listserves for sending emails to several lab members at once. The lab manager or Dr. Gard will add you to the appropriate listserves - remind them if they don't!
    * gardlabseniorstaff@umd.edu = PI, graduate students, staff, postdocs
    * gardlabundergrad@umd.edu = undergraduate research assistants  
    * Staff: To add someone to a lab listserve email, click on the menu in the top right of your gmail inbox frontpage. Click "groups". Click "add members".
    * Staff: If you need to create a new listserve email, you need to request this through UMD IT. Go here: https://umd.service-now.com/itsupport?id=service&service=fd7603b637911e406574c97a43990ebb
