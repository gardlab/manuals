# Manuals

This repository contains lab manuals for the Growth And Resilience across Development (GARD) Lab. The GARD Lab is located at the University of Maryland, College Park and is directed by Dr. Arianna Gard.

## Why lab manuals and why github?

A lab is an organization. To effectively run our organization, we need guidelines for personal and professional conduct, systems to produce reliable research, and standardized expectations for lab members. As a publically-available platform, github allows us to more effectively work with collaborators outside our institution, invite suggestions for improving our methods, and share our research practices more broadly. We are committed to open science practices and believe this lab manual is one step towards achieving that goal.
