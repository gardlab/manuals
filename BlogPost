Here are some important pieces of information to keep in mind when creating your blog posts.

    1. Please take a look at the following example in the google drive to get an idea of what the 
    blog post should entail: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZQfs9M3fx5jUKxYQPkply8USO9KoYhFS
    
    2.Sections should be written out in google docs exactly as on the blog post. These will be edited
    by others in the lab.
        
    3. Pictures used in your post need to be open source (Unsplash, CreativeCommons,etc.). Make sure 
    to include in your blog draft the names of the artists. This will be included at the bottom of
    your post.
    
    4. Track your references and make sure they are properly formatted at the bottom of your post.
    
    5. The layout of the post should be mimicked in your google doc. Where do you want your text vs.
    the pictures in your post? Make sure to keep layout in mind as you create your post. 
    
    6. The length of the post should be as long as is needed to properly get the information you are 
    researching across to your audience.
