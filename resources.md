# RESOURCES, RESOURCES, RESOURCES!

There are TONS of resources online and in person that trainees and Dr. Gard have used or heard about. If you find a resource helpful that is not on this list, add it! The purpose of this document is to store all of the information in one central location. Some trainings are required of all lab members; others will only be relevant to some. 

## Trainings (for everyone)
All of the following at trainings that must be completed before you start working in the lab. In some cases, you will attend a lab-wide training during your first semester in the GARD Lab.
*  **UMD History** The African American History and Landmarks at UMD Tour. In-person where possible. https://bsos.umd.edu/diversity/african-american-history-and
*  **History of the "DMV"** (i.e., DC, Maryland, Virginia). Our lab is situated in context - in a physical space that carries with it history. It is our job to learn about that history so we can do better and more just research and outreach. It could take a lifetime to learn about the history of this region, but there are several books that can help. All of these books are available in the lab library or UMD library system for check out. 
   * Chocolate City: A History of Race and Democracy in the Nation's Capital, by Asch and Musgrove
   * Lakeland: African Americans in College Park, by The Lakeland Community Heritage Project 
   * Prince George's County: Maryland (MD) (Black America), by Rowe, Thomas, and Woods
*  **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Training** Lab staff should request an annual training for the lab through the UMD Office of Diversity and Inclusion [here](https://diversity.umd.edu/training-education/diversity-training/)
*  **Human Subjects Research** All lab members working on a research project must complete [IRB training](https://research.umd.edu/irbtraining). This includes (a) CITI (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) Training, and (b) HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) Training. There may be additional IRB trainings required for specific projects. That information will be listed here once it becomes available.

## Trainings/Resources (for some)
There are several major research areas that the lab tackles. Each method/approach requires heavy investment - this is why we specialize! You can't know everything - we collaborate with other experts while you become an expert in 1-2 well-defined methods/approaches. 
* **Program Policies** All new graduate students (Clinical, Developmental, NACS) are required to review their area's graduate student handbook and promptly set up a meeting with Dr. Gard for discussion. This should occur before the Fall semester of your first year or shortly after your first semester begins. 
   *  [Clinical Psych](https://psyc.umd.edu/graduate/clinical-psychology)
   *  [Developmental Psych](https://psyc.umd.edu/graduate/developmental-program)
   *  [Neuroscience and Cognitive Neuroscience](https://nacs.umd.edu/landingtopic/current-nacs-students)
* **Linux bash command line** - most folks in the lab need to learn how to navigate in the command line environment. Our server, basil, is best accessed from a SSH client. Below are a few resources that will give you a basic introduction to linux command line. If you find a resource that you like, please add it here with some notes about how it is different/better/more fun than those listed below! 
   * https://linuxcommand.org/
   * https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview
   * http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/
   * https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/genomics-workshop/online-video-modules (a couple introductory videos from my collaborator at Michigan)
* **fMRI** - functional MRI is a major focus on the lab. Graduate students with a focus on fMRI research should intend to take Dr. Luis Pessoa's NACS course "Introduction to Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging". In addition, there are several online courses that can be incredibly helpful, some geared towards different packages. 
   * Andy Jahn's Brain Book (has tutorials for several programs): https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
   * NIH fMRI course - slides and videos: https://fmrif.nimh.nih.gov/public/fmri-course/index_html

   * Poldrack, Russell A. Mumford, Jeanette A. Nichols, Thomas E. Handbook of functional MRI data analysis. 2011 --> it looks like there is a free PDF copy of this book posted [here](http://www.leixulab.net/paper/2011HandbookfMRI.pdf)

* **R Statistical Software** - one of the most flexible (and free!) statistical software packages available is R. There is an incredible online support system and resources for statistical analysis and data visualization within R. Using R further allows the lab to engage in reproducible open science practices. But the learning curve can be steep. In addition to learning what statistical tools are at your disposal, the assumptions of each tool, and the theory behind it, you have to figure out *how* to implement said tool/approach in R. All trainees working on a project that involves data analysis needs to learn the basics of R. For graduate students, you will get some of this training in your first year stats courses and in subsequent stats courses germaine to your research program. But here are some helpful resources for R newbies and experts alike:
